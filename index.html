                        model from another model is going to be their posing ability and their walk. </p>

                    <p class="modeling">â€˜I am Supriya Punekar and for the last 2 months, I worked as a photo model. I
                        have a huge passion for acting and I love being in front of the camera. I mainly shoot fashion,
                        swimwear and lingerie but I also enjoy creative projects like bodypaint or dress up. I am
                        currently modelling for XYZ Model Agency and individual photographers. My photos were published
                        in ABC and CBA magazines and I was part of LALALA campaign. I am available for photoshoots in
                        California, but available to travel to other destinations in the US.
